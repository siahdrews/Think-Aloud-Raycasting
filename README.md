# Think-Aloud-Raycasting
Think Aloud project for 2024/SP Computer Science 1

## For this think aloud, I will be making a Raycaster in C++ using OpenGL
I will be following a youtube tutorial I found
* https://youtu.be/gYRrGTC7GtA?si=QM_g67pw7hF0Dc4P

## The main steps I will be taking will be:
* Creating a 2D grid to be converted into a 3D environment
* Casting rays from a single point within this grid
* Converting the 2D grid into a 3D environment
* Adding textures to the 3D environment

## This project will help me:
- build my skills in C++
- learn how to use OpenGL

I hope for my project to end up as something similar to the original DOOM or Wolfenstein 3D
